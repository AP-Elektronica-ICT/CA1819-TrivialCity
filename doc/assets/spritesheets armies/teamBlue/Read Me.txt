If you use this guard sprite in any way, you must give credit to me. (Nanaki)
They are put in order of appearence for the code itself. The purple MUST stay
that way or the the area surrounding the guard will be the color you changed it. (duh)
The Paused and LOADING pics are to replace the "Paused" and "GET PSYCHED!"
Pics in the VGRAPH.(WL1,WL6,SOD,) File. I made these sprites throught flo edit, Microsoft Paint, and even Paint Phop Pro 7.

I had finished an old WOLF shareware version called "Tailsstein" It was the first add-on I made. 
It has not been posted on the net so if you want it, email me at Jtschuld3@netscape.net. Right now I'm working on the sequal. "The Fall of Tails" a full version Spear of Destiny with more renewed graphics, guns, and I have even put an escort mission in where you must Get B.J into a truck to safty. Nifty eh?
I am willing to take some requests from anyone who want's me to help with sprites, Images in VGRAPH, walls, you name it! I can paint it. DON'T ASK ME BOUT' CODING!!! I suck at coding and know nothing about it. I will come out with the guns I used, along with the gun static spries. I will even put out my Tails sprites that took me even longer to make! I will give out text I had redone, and anything else that I had changed to the public. Have fun with these sprites!
